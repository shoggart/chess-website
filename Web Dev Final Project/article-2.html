                </p>

                <p>The FIDE Candidates Tournament continues on November 1, 2020 in either Tbilisi, Georgia or Yekaterinburg, Russia. The International Chess Federation recently announced this in lieu of the fact that it had been suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
                </p>

                <p>The Russian news organization TASS recently released this news citing Andrei Simanovsky, who is President of Sverdlovsk Chess Federation. Simanovsky is in regular contact with FIDE President Arkady Dvorkovich who gave him a notice declaring that the Yekaterinburg coordinators "are ready" to resume the competition between October 28-November 11, if conditions will be “safe for the players."
                </p>

                <p>Confirmation wasn’t initially provided by FIDE, but they have now officially announced the tournament will resume. Round eight will begin on November 1, 2020 which will be the first round of the second half of the tournament.
                </p>

                <p>Tbilisi, Georgia has been named as a secondary host city in the eventuality that the Covid-19 situation worsens in Yekaterinburg between now and then.
                </p>

                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p class="mb-0">Tbilisi has been officially approved by FIDE as an alternate host city and will hold the tournament on the same time schedule if the situation requires it. Fide officially stated that they "are also in touch with other potential host cities” in the case that the situation worsens in both Russia and Georgia in the meantime.</p>

                </blockquote>

                <p>The tournament initially was held between March 17-25 in Yekaterinburg, but was postponed halfway through when air travel restrictions in and out Russia began due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
                </p>

                <p>The current leaders in the tournament are GM Maxime Vachier-Lagrave from France and GM Ian Nepomniachtchi from Russia who each have 4.5/7 points.
                </p>
