                <p class="lead">Chess 9LX and St. Louis Rapid & Blitz</p>

                <p>Two historic competitions coordinated by the St. Louis Chess Club will be hosted online one month from now: the Champions Showdown: Chess 9LX (Sept. 11-13) and the St. Louis Rapid and Blitz (Sept. 15-19). The first competition is a round-robin, implying that former World Champion GM Garry Kasparov and current World Champion GM Magnus Carlsen will be officially competing against each other for the first time since 2004.
                </p>

                <p>When the Grand Chess Tour was rescinded due to the Covid-19 emergency, various competitions were abruptly removed from the schedule. One of the Grand Chess Tour’s events has been reinstated in an online format: the St. Louis Rapid and Blitz.
                </p>

                <p>The club additionally has an annual Chess960 tournament (called Chess9LX), which fortunately wasn't dropped either seeing that GM Garry Kasparov will once again be participating!
                </p>

                <p>Online chess was never a major thing for GM Garry Kasparov during his tenure as World Champion, mainly due to the fact that there were far fewer online events taking place. This will be the first official online event he has taken part in since retiring.</p>
                <p>Joining Kasparov at the event will be the world No. 1 and No. 2 of classical chess, GMs Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana, as well as current Chess960 World Champion Wesley So and the up-and-coming GM Alireza Firouzja.
                </p>

                <p>This year the tournament will be in a round-robin format, instead the one-on-one matches we saw last year. Accordingly, Kasparov will be competing against the other nine participants, including Carlsen. It should be a memorable event, even though it’s in an online 960 format, as Kasparov and Carlsen have only faced each other once previously. Their previous encounter was in rapid and blitz format, and it occurred in 2004 in Reykjavik, while Carlsen was only 13 years of age and Kasparov 41, a year prior to his retirement.
                </p>

                <p>In 2017, when Kasparov participated in the St. Louis Rapid and Blitz competition, he could have met Carlsen, however, as it turned out Carlsen didn’t compete in that event.
                </p>

                <p>In Chess960 (also known as Fischerrandom), the beginning position is not quite the same as in normal chess. While the pawns' positions remain as before, minor pieces (bishops & knights) and major pieces (the king, queen & rooks) are semi-randomly placed on the first and eighth ranks.
                </p>

                <p>The competition starts September 11 and ends September 13 with three rounds each day. Players will be given their starting position three minutes prior to each round. The time control will be 20 minutes with 10-second move increments. The winner will receive a prize of $150,000.
                </p>

                <p>After the Champions Showdown event, the St. Louis Chess Club will kick off the St. Louis Rapid & Blitz tournament and it’s back to normal chess.
                </p>

                <p>The Saint Louis Rapid and Blitz adheres to the standard Grand Chess Tour schedule with three days of rapid and three rounds each day followed by two days of blitz and nine rounds each day. The rapid time controls will be 25 minutes with a 25 second move increment and blitz will be 5 minutes with a 3 second move increment. The winner will receive $250,000.
                </p>

                <p>The matches will begin every day at 1:00 p.m. St. Louis time (GMT-5). Renowned experts and professional chess players such as GMs Yasser Seirawan, GM Maurice Ashley, WGM Jennifer Shahade, WFM Alexandra Botez, GM Robert Hess, IM Levy Rozman and IM Anna Rudolf will be providing commentary.
                </p>
