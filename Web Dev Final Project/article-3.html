                <p class="lead">Latest Version of Stockfish Released!</p>

                <h1>Stockfish 12</h1>

                <p>The latest version of the renowned chess engine, Stockfish 12, was released on Thursday. For the first time it includes an efficiently updateable neural network (NNUE) and has been shown to be much stronger than previous versions of Stockfish.
                </p>

                <p>Stockfishs’ official blog reports that Stockfish 12 is undoubtedly much stronger than any of its predecessors and will “typically win at least 10 times more game pairs than it loses" when competing against Stockfish 11.
                </p>

                    <p class="mb-0">"Stockfish 12 will typically win at least 10 times more game pairs than it loses.""</p>
                    <footer class="blockquote-footer">
                        <cite title="Source Title">Official Stockfish Blog</cite>
                    </footer>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Stockfish 12 is estimated to have a rating that is 130 Elo points higher than its predecessor Stockfish 11. Internal progression tests were used to measure this during its development, and Chess.com recently confirmed this in their computer chess environment where Stockfish+NNUE had a comparable performance to Leela Chess Zero.</p>

                <p>The NNUE was the main contributor to this monumental jump in strength, although Stockfish is still a CPU-only engine.
                </p>

                <p>Stockfish originally utilized brute-force techniques and played itself millions of times to develop chess strategies. It has now combined the brute-force techniques with the additional NNUE capabilities of Google’s well-known AlphaZero and Leela Chess Zero chess engines.
                </p>

                <p>Two evaluation techniques are available in the latest version. These options include the classical evaluation function along with the NNUE evaluation which utilizes neural networks combined with some basic inputs. Millions of positions are used to train and optimize the network.
                </p>

                <p>Stockfish 12 is open-source and free to download at https://stockfishchess.org/download/ with the neural network already installed and ready to go!
